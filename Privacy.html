        <h3 class="supTitle"><br>About Artemis Lab</h3>
        <p class="session">
            Artemis Lab is an independent mobile software developer. 
            We are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or officially connected with 
            any third-party companies or platforms mentioned in our Services.

<p class="session">
    <strong>0. No Collection of Your Personal Content</strong><br>
    We do not collect, upload, store, share, analyze, or transmit any personal content from your device—including 
    photos, videos, messages, notifications, media files, or documents—to Artemis Lab servers or any third-party servers.  
    All content processing required for app features (such as photo analysis, file scanning, message recovery, 
    or device storage optimization) takes place entirely on your device. Your personal content never leaves your phone 
    and is never accessible to us or to any external party.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>1. Advertising Identifiers:</strong><br>
    We may access your device’s advertising identifiers (Google Advertising ID, Apple IDFA) to provide personalized ads, 
    frequency capping, fraud detection, and performance analytics. These identifiers do not reveal your name, files, photos, 
    messages, or direct personal identity.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>2. Device & Technical Log Data:</strong><br>

</p>

<ul class="session">

    <li>Error logs and crash diagnostics</li>
    <li>Performance metrics</li>
</ul>

<p class="session">
    <strong>3. Usage Analytics:</strong><br>
    We may collect anonymized usage metrics (e.g., which features are used) to improve product functionality.  
    No personal content such as photos, videos, messages, files, or private media is ever uploaded or accessed by us.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>4. In-App Permissions:</strong><br>
    If the Services require access to features like camera, photo library, notifications, or storage, 
    such permissions are used strictly for core app functionality.  
    All processing is performed locally on your device and not transmitted to any server.
</p>
