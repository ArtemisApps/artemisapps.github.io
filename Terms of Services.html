            We are not affiliated, endorsed, associated, or partnered with any third-party companies mentioned 
            within the Services, including but not limited to advertising networks, analytics providers,

        </p>

        <h3 class="supTitle"><br>4. License to Use the Services</h3>
        <p class="session">
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use 
            our mobile applications solely for personal, non-commercial use, in accordance with these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="supTitle"><br>5. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p class="session">
            You agree to use the Services responsibly and not engage in any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="session">
            <li>Reverse engineering, modifying, or decompiling the app</li>
            <li>Using the Services for unlawful or harmful purposes</li>
            <li>Circumventing security features or protection mechanisms</li>
            <li>Interfering with servers, networks, or infrastructure</li>
            <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Services</li>
            <li>Uploading malicious code, viruses, or harmful scripts</li>
            <li>Misusing any in-app permissions or data access rights</li>
        </ul>

<h3 class="supTitle"><br>6. In-App Purchases, Subscriptions, Trials, and Billing</h3>

<p class="session">
    Some of our Services may offer optional in-app purchases (“IAP”) or auto-renewable subscriptions 
    that provide access to premium features. All purchases and billing operations are handled directly 
    by the platform provider (Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Artemis Lab does not collect, store, 
    or process any payment or credit card information.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.1 Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</strong><br>
    If you subscribe to a premium plan, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each 
    billing period (weekly, monthly, yearly, or as specified) unless canceled at least 24 hours before 
    the renewal date. Your account will be charged for the renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of 
    the current period.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.2 Free Trials</strong><br>
    If a free trial is offered, any unused portion of the trial will expire once the user purchases a subscription.  
    Unless canceled at least 24 hours before the trial period ends, your subscription will automatically convert 
    to a paid plan and the applicable fee will be charged to your platform account.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.3 How to Manage or Cancel Your Subscription</strong><br>
    You may modify or cancel your subscription at any time through your platform account settings:
</p>

<ul class="session">
    <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</li>
    <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Google Play Store → Profile → Payments & Subscriptions → Subscriptions</li>
</ul>

<p class="session">
    Deleting the app does <strong>not</strong> cancel your subscription. You must cancel through your 
    Apple or Google account settings to avoid auto-renewal charges.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.4 Refund Policy</strong><br>
    
</p>



<p class="session">
    Refund eligibility is determined solely by the platform provider（Apple App Store or Google Play Store）and subject to their policies, 
    including regional consumer protection laws where applicable.  
    Artemis Lab does not override or influence refund decisions.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.5 Pricing & Changes</strong><br>
    We reserve the right to modify subscription pricing at any time.  
    If prices change, you will be notified by Apple or Google before renewal.  
    Continued use after the price change constitutes acceptance.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.6 Unauthorized or Fraudulent Purchases</strong><br>
    Users are responsible for securing their device and account credentials.  
    Artemis Lab is not responsible for unauthorized purchases made through the user’s account or device.
</p>

<p class="session">
    <strong>6.7 Compliance With Local Laws</strong><br>
    Subscription terms and refund rights may vary based on regional consumer laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, EU Consumer Rights Directive).  
    Where required, local legal protections will apply in addition to these Terms.
</p>

        <h3 class="supTitle"><br>7. Advertisements & Third-Party Content</h3>
        <p class="session">
            Our Services may display ads from trusted third-party networks such as Google AdMob, Applovin, 
            Pangle, and Facebook Audience Network.  
            We do not control the content of third-party ads and are not responsible for their accuracy, safety, 
            or privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h3 class="supTitle"><br>8. Third-Party SDKs & Integrations</h3>
        <p class="session">
            Our Services may include interactions with third-party SDKs for analytics, advertising, crash reporting, 
            and performance monitoring.  
            Use of these SDKs is governed by their respective privacy policies, listed in our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
